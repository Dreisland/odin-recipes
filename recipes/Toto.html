    <li>
      Carefully fold the egg whites into the batter, rotating the bowl with each
      fold. If folding in the egg whites appears too difficult, run the batter
      with the egg whites in a food processor or mixer for a few seconds only to
      combine and ensure the egg whites retain air in order for the cake to be
      fluffy.

      is left with residue.
