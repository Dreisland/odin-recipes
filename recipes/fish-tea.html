      Why is it called fish tea? It is because the soup bit (broth) is much
      thinner than other types of Jamaican soups and usually contains fewer
      ingredients. Also, according to us Jamaicans, tea is the remedy for every
      sickness, and we drink fish tea soup when we have a cold/flu.
