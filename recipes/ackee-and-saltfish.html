    <h3>Ackee & Saltfish</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb salted fish</li>
      <li>1 can of ackee</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 large fresh chopped tomato</li>
      <li>half each of chopped red, green and yellow peppers</li>
      <li>1 large onion chopped</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>3 sprigs of thyme</li>
      <li>
        half a scotch bonnet pepper, deseeded and finely choppedsalt and black
        pepper to taste
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the saltfish overnight in a bowl of water. After soaking throw the
        water away. Add fresh water to a pan and boil the saltfish for 20 mins.
        Drain, de-bone and peel any skin that may remain on the fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the oil in the pan and add the onion, garlic, peppers, tomato and
        thyme. Fry on a very low heat for 15 mins, cover the pan if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break the saltfish into small bite-sized pieces then drain the ackee,
        add both the to the pan. Gently fold the ingredients together â€“ the
        ackee is very delicate so try not to stir too much. Cover and cook for a
        further 10 mins. Serve with basmati rice and fried plantain.
